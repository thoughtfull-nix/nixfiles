* Nixfiles for NixOS
** nixos
An installation/rescue ISO file based on the NixOS installation ISO file, but preconfigured with my
user accounts and modules.

It has all the tools I need to provision a new machine, reprovision, or rescue an existing machine.

The ~run-vm~ script will boot the ISO on a qemu VM.
